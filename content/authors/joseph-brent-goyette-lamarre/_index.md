Joseph currently works at Castor Optics, a photonics company based in Montreal that focuses on all fiber optical components with an emphasis on linear optics and minimal power loss. He studied at the Univeristy of Waterloo where he obtained a B.Sc. in Honours Physics, graduating with disctinctions. He is fascinated by the interface between quantum optics and biology, but also has a strong penchant for nuclear fusion. More broadly, he wishes to use machine learning and parralel computing applied through stochastic processes to make sense of unruly mathematics.
